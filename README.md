### Hi! I'm Jorge, from Monterrey Mexico! ðŸ‘‹

- I've been a programmer for 33 years, during that time I've learned several programming languages including Basic, Cobol, Pascal, dBase III+, Clipper, C, PowerBuilder, JavaScript and C#. 

- My strongest points are: C with 25 years of experience so far, and C# with 6 years of experience so far.

- I've written sofware for business and government and the web, but I also have written IT Tools such as: Command Interpreters, Application Engines, Database Engines and Compilers.

- I'm among the few programmes that can say they've created thier own programming language, robust and reach enough to be used on production apps for 20 years.

- I've been working in the Game industry for the last 6 years, with 4 games published so far.
