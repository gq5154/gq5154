### Hi, I'm Jorge, from Monterrey, Mexico! ðŸ‘‹

- I've been a programmer since 1987, during this time I've learned several programming languages including: Basic, Cobol, Pascal, dBase III+, Clipper, C, PowerBuilder, JavaScript and C#, and even created my own language.

- I've been working as Unity Game developer since 2014, with 4 published games.
 
- I'm among the few programmes that can say they've created thier own programming language, robust and reach enough to be used on production apps for 20 years.

- My strongest points are: C with 25+ years of experience so far, and C# with 7+ years of experience so far.

- I've written sofware for business, government and the web, but I also have written IT Tools such as: Command Interpreters, Application Engines, Database Engines and Compilers.
